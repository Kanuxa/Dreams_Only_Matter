                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To create our website, first, we started to work on the individual parts to get familiar with or refresh our knowledge about HTML, CSS, and JS. After a few practices, we decided to start working on our website daily. Since we had to make at least a meaningful commitment per day, we decided to meet either online or in life and work on a website all together. As we were building the website, we found it useful to watch some tutorials on YouTube. The most challenging parts were understanding the box-container concept, differentiating margin and padding, and understanding position and display properties.

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we learned the basics, we were ready to start doing some practices. To practice on creating the website we were trying to write codes for some simple pages. Practicing coding involved writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to create different elements of a website. This included structuring the HTML content, styling elements using CSS for visual presentation, and adding interactivity with JavaScript. That hugely helped us to get used to element arranging.

                <p class="sectionText">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it came to the implementation, we started to think of design of our pages. We were trying to draw the pages first and the to start coding based on those paintings. Doing that, we made the process of coding a lot easier since we were not rewriting the same piece of code several times.
