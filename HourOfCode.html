                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before hosting the Hour of Code event, we decided to complete all the preparations. As our first step, we got permission from school №60 with the help of Ms. Ayten Qiblaliyeva* and registered our event on code.org*. Then we went through all the guidelines to the Hour of Code event. After that, we had to decide on the age of our audience to prepare our presentation appropriately. While selecting the grade, our choice stopped in eighth grade. We agreed that exactly this grade pupils have the highest chances to benefit from the Hour of Code event. Thanks to Ms. Gulnar Yusifli* and Ms. Elvira Hasanova*, we successfully reserved an Informatics room (with computers). However, there was a challenge for us: despite this classroom having a better environment in comparison to the other ones, it was way too small.

                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going further, we worked on our individual parts of this assignment on code.org to be more comfortable with the games (shown in a picture below) we were preparing for pupils. We also defined the roles and responsibilities for each of us (speaker, presenter, photographer/supporter, photographer/supporter). We believed that with this responsibility distribution, we would use our time most efficiently. Finally, we thought and practiced the way we were going to present. One of the key points at this stage was to not make our presentation boring or lame. Our presentation was aimed to attract pupils’ attention as much as possible and involve them in active problem-solving.

                        <p class="contentText">Moving to the presentation stage, we met at the school a bit earlier to ensure that everything was working. Before starting the presentation, we had some time to talk to pupils about their school life. Through these talks, we created a friendly atmosphere in the class and defined that none of the pupils was familiar with coding. After a brief overview of the Hour of Code, we showed them a presentation about ADA University. As we saw, several pupils already had done some research and had overall information about ADA University; moreover, those were even planning to apply there after graduation from the school. Generally, pupils were impressed that we have a university with a lot of opportunities for its students. Then we started to talk about algorithms. We gave them a simple-looking task: create an algorithm for one of us to reach one of the pupils. As we were expecting, they made a lot of mistakes giving incorrect and ambiguous instructions. We made them to think on questions like “How many steps?”, “What size of step?”, “What angle of rotation?”, and finally “Can we make it with fewer instructions?”.  That way, in a real-life example we showed them how precise, accurate, and effective should be the algorithms.</p>

                        <p class="contentText">Unfortunately, one of our teammates didn’t come to the event, so we had to change our plans a bit. Since we left with only 3 team members, we decided to let pupils show their solutions on the blackboard and discuss possible mistakes and resolutions for them. We provided the pupils with a QR code and a link to code.org and explained that we would solve several tasks like the one we showed a bit earlier in real life. For the first couple of tasks, they were not interested since the tasks were so easy for them. Seeing that, we skipped some of the tasks and moved to more difficult ones to make pupils focus on the process. Indeed, the next tasks attracted their attention and engaged them to discuss and find out the most optimal solutions for those tasks. They event decided to get into several groups and discuss the problem as a group giving some advice to their classmate who was solving the task on a blackboard. As it appeared, the small sizes of the room worked in our favor since pupils could easily break into the groups.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p class="contentText">On a specific task, they stuck for a while and at this moment we explained to them what is debugging and how we can utilize it in a given task. Exploring step-by-step actions, they figured up the issue and were able to fix it. As we were doing the tasks, we were showing the code in the JS language and explaining what was going on there. All the pupils were impressed that they were learning coding by playing a simple game. When an hour of coding was complete, some of the pupils showed great interest and asked to show what they could do in the future if they continued coding. While just listing some specialties, such as cybersecurity, AI development, and network engineering, we also showed them some scripts in the React project and the actual website that the code was running. The fact that they could start writing such websites in just a couple of years inspired them.</p>

                    <p class="contentText" style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, when we were going to leave, happened something unexpected; another eighth grade asked us to hold the Hour of Code with them as well. Since our schedules were allowing us to stay for one more hour, we could not deny their request. Nevertheless, we could not stay in the Informatics room anymore and that’s why we quickly set up the projector in another classroom. The process of teaching was mainly the same. However, while the first half of the tasks were easy for this group of pupils, the second half came to be a bit harder. They did not understand how they could use loops and conditions to enhance their codes. To make it clear to them, first, we started writing the codes without any loops and conditions. And then we added loops and conditions one by one where they were needed. As a result, they started to look closer and recognize the parts of a route where they could shorten their codes. This group also liked the Hour of Code and even started to explore some other activities on code.org.</p>
