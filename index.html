            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team name - <strong style="font-size: 25px;">Dreams Only Matter</strong> - represents well known DOM (Document Object Model) structure. As we were pacionate As we were passionate about working with JS language, we tried to create a lot of dynamic elements in the web pages. While doing that we concluded that with dreams you can create whatever you want in a web page with JS.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our logo, as you can see, combines the letters J and S. The creativity of the logo once again shows that there are no boundaries in web page coding. Another interesting fact is that the logo could be of any color if you just think of it!)
